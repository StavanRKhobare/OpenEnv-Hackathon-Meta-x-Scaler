"""Grader for Task 2 — Conflict Classification (medium).

Scoring
-------
    1.0  — exact match with the ground-truth violation type
    0.5  — same constraint family (resource-limit or temporal-ordering)
    0.1  — valid category but from a different family
    0.0  — empty or completely unrecognised response

Constraint families (related groups for partial credit)
-------------------------------------------------------
    Resource-limit family : resource_overload, capacity_exceeded
        Both concern the number of jobs concurrently on a machine.
    Temporal-ordering family : deadline_violation, precedence_violation
        Both concern the sequencing and timing of job execution.
    Standalone : availability_conflict
        Concerns machine operational windows (no close sibling).

After each call, ``last_breakdown`` holds a dict describing the decision.
